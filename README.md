## Note: 
This repository does not contain the source code of the Mesophil´s Cities mod as long as it is in beta phase. I decided to split the repository because I started work on this mod without any Java knowledge by using MCreator and slowly learned as I developed, including more and more custom code. This however, lead to functional, yet very messy and unstructured code, partially Mcreator-generated,  that I´m definitely going to structure and clear up before the mod´s full release.
To make the code already available to the public, I decided to release the beta source code in [a separate repository](https://github.com/Quatryl23/Mesophils-Cities-beta) where everyone who really wants to (have fun trying to decrypt this code!) can have a look at the source code while this, the main repository doesn´t get flooded with unstructured, improvable code.
